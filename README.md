# The Community Plugins Project for Autopsy ForensicVM

## Introduction

Welcome to the Community Plugins Project - a collaborative platform where we extend the capabilities of the Autospsy ForensicVM project by developing a series of useful plugins. These plugins are designed to enhance the functionality of the ForensicVM, enabling security bypass, program installation, and other tools that forensic investigators find necessary in their routine work. 

## Project Purpose

Autopsy ForensicVM already offers an array of powerful features for forensic investigations. However, to cater to the diverse and specific needs of the community, we're always striving to improve and extend its functionalities. That's where the Community Plugins Project comes into play. 

We're building a suite of plugins that will provide new and improved features, allowing you to adapt the ForensicVM to your specific needs. This initiative ensures that our tools stay on the cutting edge, meeting the evolving demands of forensic investigations in the digital era.

## Plugin Features

1. **Security Bypass**: With these plugins, forensic investigators can bypass various security protocols, allowing them to analyze systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. It's important to note that these features should be used responsibly and within the legal boundaries.

2. **Program Installation**: Want to integrate a new tool into your ForensicVM? Our plugins facilitate smooth program installations, ensuring the tools you need are right at your fingertips.

3. **Tailored Tools**: Our plugins will include a variety of customizable tools designed to cater to the unique needs of forensic investigators. Haven't found the tool you need? Build it!
